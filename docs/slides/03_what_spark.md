# What do you think ?


Give me 2-3 facts you know that defines ![Apache Spark](./images/spark-logo-rev.svg) ?

Notes:
Interact with the audience to gather what they know about Apache Spark
Maybe run an interactive Miro session to gather each student knowledge

Perfect tool for data engineer scenario:
- Ingestion
- Cleaning
- Transformation
- Publishing



# Spark as Data scientist tool
<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left" -->
Typical use through notebooks in interactive session

Data engineers often offloads data scientist:
- Deliver data such as ML models
- Provide industrialization

Notes:
- Notebooks: Zeppelin, Jupyter (ie Spark-shell but much more featured)



# Spark is multilingual

Spark is written in Scala but you can code with Spark using Scala, Java, Python and R 

Notes:
- Python is very trendy those days
- Spark Scala API gets update earlier 



# Conclusion
<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left" -->
Spark fits many needs:
- More features in one tool
- Easier to use
- Wider audience
